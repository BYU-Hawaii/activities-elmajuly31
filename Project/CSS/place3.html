        <h2>Explore the beauty of Savaii</h2>
        <p>Savai'i is the biggest island in Samoa, and it's like a really pretty place with lots of cool nature stuff.
            There are super nice beaches, big forests, and really tall mountains made by volcanoes. If you like swimming 
            or snorkeling, you'll see lots of colorful fish in the clear water. People have lived here for a long time, 
            so there are old villages and special places from the past, like really old buildings and stuff. The people 
            here are really friendly, and life is really calm and peaceful. It's a great place to explore nature and feel 
            happy.</p>
