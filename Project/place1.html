            <h2>Paradise on Earth</h2>
            
            <p> This is a short tour of where Im from, the place I was born and raised in. A place that I will hold special in my heart
                no matter where and how far I go. This place is one of the sacred place to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
                David O. McKay blessed Sauniatu when he came to Samoa, and until now many prophets have came and visit here. Just recently, Elder
                Rasband went there to visit the primary school and the people there few months ago. I felt so happy just how blessed I am and our 
                families that have been living there. Sauniatu has always felt like paradise and it is well-known as the place of blessings and happiness.
                The waterfall, cool breeze and everything surrounded by mountains is just what we need.
